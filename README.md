Keystone Demo
=============

This site is an example of a default Keystone application.

Try it out at http://demo.keystonejs.com

It's a great basis to use when starting a Keystone project; just `git clone`
this repository and start making changes.

Pull requests are welcome, or if you'd like to see additional demos just open a
new issue.


## Development &amp; Support

If you're interested in using Keystone for a project and would like to work with
the developers who built it please visit [Team 9](http://www.team9.com.au) and
get in touch.

Much of Keystone was based on the best patterns we found ourselves repeating,
and is now used for most of our projects.

We can also provide commercial support for Keystone and do custom solution
development and implementation.
