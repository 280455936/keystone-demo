		h1 Welcome to Keystone
		p.lead
			| This example site demonstrates how to set up common patterns in Keystone.
		p.lead
			| It includes the latest versions of 
			| <a href='http://http://getbootstrap.com/' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a> (currently 3.0.0) 
			| and <a href='http://www.jquery.com/' target='_blank'>jQuery</a> (currently 1.10.3)
			| so you can use it as a base to quickly start a new project.
		
		h2 Usage
		p
			a(href='/keystone/signin') Sign in
			|  to try out the Keystone Admin UI using the demo account:
		dl.dl-horizontal
			dt Username
			dd demo@keystonejs.com
			dt Password
			dd demo
		p You can use the Admin UI to create your own user, if you like.
		p To use this site as the basis for your own project, 
			a(href='https://github.com/JedWatson/keystone-demo/archive/master.zip') download the .zip file
			|  and start customising.

		h3 Download CSV
		p For an example of how to download a list in .csv format, see <code>/routes/download/users.js</code>.
			| It uses the excellent <a href='http://www.adaltas.com/projects/node-csv/'>node-csv</a> library.
		p: a(href='/download/users').btn.btn-default Download users
		
		h3 Session Management
		p Keystone includes session management and default sign-in and sign-out views.
		p They are turned on for this demo:
			ul
				li: a(href='/keystone/signin') /keystone/signin
				li: a(href='/keystone/signout') /keystone/signout
		//- p You can also replace them with custom views to brand them or add functionality like signup or forgotten password retrieval, like these ones:
		//- 	ul
		//- 		li: a(href='/signin') /signin
		//- 		li: a(href='/signout') /signout
		//- p If you implement custom session management views, you usually want to turn off the built-in views setting 
		//- 	| <code>auth</code> to <code>keystone.session.keystoneAuth</code>.
		//- 	| You can also set <code>auth</code> to your own function if you want to customise the authorisation logic.
		
		h3 Errors
		p The <code>404</code> and <code>500</code> views demonstrate how to set up error handlers for your application.
		p To see the <code>404</code> page in action, simply go to <a href='/404'>any url</a> that doesn't exist.
