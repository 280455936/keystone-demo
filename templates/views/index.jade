		h3 Session Management
		p Keystone includes session management and default sign-in and sign-out views.
		p They are turned on for this demo:
			ul
				li: a(href='/keystone/signin') /keystone/signin
				li: a(href='/keystone/signout') /keystone/signout
		//- p You can also replace them with custom views to brand them or add functionality like signup or forgotten password retrieval, like these ones:
		//- 	ul
		//- 		li: a(href='/signin') /signin
		//- 		li: a(href='/signout') /signout
		//- p If you implement custom session management views, you usually want to turn off the built-in views setting 
		//- 	| <code>auth</code> to <code>keystone.session.keystoneAuth</code>.
		//- 	| You can also set <code>auth</code> to your own function if you want to customise the authorisation logic.
		
		h3 Errors
		p The <code>404</code> and <code>500</code> views demonstrate how to set up error handlers for your application.
		p To see the <code>404</code> page in action, simply go to <a href='/404'>any url</a> that doesn't exist.
